## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository. This is where I practice for the **CS416P course at PSU** on **Computer Sound and Music**. Throughout this course, I will explore various concepts related to sound synthesis, audio processing, and music computing.

All the projects and exercises here will be implemented using **Python**.
